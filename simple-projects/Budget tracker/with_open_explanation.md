# Understanding File Handling in Python

In this section, we explain the statement `with open(filePath, "r") as file:` used in Python for handling files.

## 1. `open(filePath, "r")`
The `open()` function is a built-in function in Python used to open files. It takes two key arguments:
- **`filePath`**: The path or name of the file you want to open.
- **`"r"`**: This is the mode in which we open the file. In this case, `"r"` stands for **read mode**. Below are some common modes:
  - `"r"`: Open for reading (default).
  - `"w"`: Open for writing (creates the file if it doesn't exist or overwrites it if it does).
  - `"a"`: Open for appending (adds content to the end of the file without erasing existing content).
  - `"r+"`: Open for both reading and writing.

For example:
```python
file = open("data.txt", "r")
```

## 2. Using `with`
The `with` statement is a context manager in Python that simplifies working with resources like files. When using `with`, Python automatically handles opening and closing the file. This ensures the file is closed properly, even if an error occurs during reading or writing.

For example:
```python
with open("data.txt", "r") as file:
    data = file.read()
```
In this case:
- **Open the file** named `data.txt` in **read mode**.
- Assign the opened file object to the variable `file`.
- After exiting the `with` block, the file is automatically closed.

## 3. `as file`
The `as file` part assigns the opened file object to the variable `file`. This variable is used to interact with the file, such as reading or writing content.

## Why Use `with`?
- **Automatic File Closing**: Files are automatically closed after you're done with them. This prevents resource leaks or potential bugs.
- **Cleaner Code**: You donâ€™t need to explicitly close the file using `file.close()`. Python does it for you when the `with` block is exited.

## Example:
```python
with open("budget_data.json", "r") as file:
    data = file.read()
    print(data)
```
In this example:
- The file `budget_data.json` is opened in read mode.
- The file object is assigned to the variable `file`.
- The file content is read using `file.read()`, and printed.
- The file is automatically closed after the block is executed.

Using the `with` statement is considered best practice in Python for file handling.
